## One shot
### Interactive story about having your bluff called

Suppose you have a bomb. It sounds like a cool thing to have, because
you can threaten to blow up everyone. You can demand things and stuff.
Now suppose you, everyone, and the bomb are in the same room. Still
pretty cool, but maybe now you'd look for a reason not to blow up
everyone. Maybe now *everyone* will demand things from *you*.

A short story made in [RenPy](renpy.org) for [Ludum Dare 44 "Your life is
currency"](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/one-shot).
